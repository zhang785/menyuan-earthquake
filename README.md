For the 2022 event:

The co-seismic slip distribution model is stored in the file "22menyuan-model.oksar."
The data format ".oksar" records information for each sub-fault patch in four lines, with the first line indicating the central position of the sub-fault, the second line providing strike, dip angle, and rake, the third line containing slip value, and the fourth line specifies both the length of the fault and the depth at the top and bottom of the sub-fault.

For the 2016 event:

The co-seismic slip uniform model is stored in the file "16menyuan-uniform.simp."
The data format ".simp" for this model represents each sub-fault patch with the following information in each row: "x(km) y(km) str(deg) dip(deg) dep(km) wid(km) leng(km) s_slip(m) d_slip(m) o_slip(m)"
The co-seismic slip distribution model is stored in the file "16menyuan-discrete.oksar."
The data format ".oksar" for this model records information for each sub-fault patch in four lines, similar to the format described for the 2022 event.
